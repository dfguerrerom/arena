# FRA Platform

## Prerequisites

First, [install Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) (modern npm replacement).

Then, install [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (currently the LTS version we are using is 6.x).

## Building web application

To build it once:

```yarn run build```

To constantly build it when something changes, run:

```yarn watch```

## Running the server

```node server/server.js```
